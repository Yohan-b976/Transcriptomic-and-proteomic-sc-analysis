# sc RNA seq pipeline
This pipeline was built during a 4 months internship in the MVD in IRIm under the supervision of Willy Lutz.This can be considered as my first work and I am happy to show you the result of my work.
## Goal of this pipeline:
This pipeline is meant to process single cell RNA seq data using different programms and methods. It is composed of 5 files in python and 1 file in R.
Jupyter notebook files (python):
-Pipeline_QC 0.3
-Prediction&Integration v0.3
-Annotation&mapping
-SEACells_meta 0.2
-DEG 0.2

R file:
-QC R (used for scDblFinder)

This pipeline was done using nasal mucosa data infected or not by Hcov229E. With some modification it can be used on any dataset of scRNA-seq.
