# Genomic-and-proteomic-analysis

This is the starting point of my new projet, the processing and the use of data from single cell studies.
I'm not quite sure what else to say as a first-timer!! Anyway, let's get started!


I began this projet using the method for Sanbomic, a bioinformatic engineer that shared his work on the internet and youtube. The raw material is available on GitHub: https://github.com/mousepixels/sanbomics_scripts/tree/main
